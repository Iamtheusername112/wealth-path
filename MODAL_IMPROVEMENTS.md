  - Stronger shadow: `shadow-2xl`
  - Better rounded corners: `sm:rounded-xl`
  - Smooth animations (zoom + slide)

### **2. Sheet Component (Side Panels/Drawers)**
**File:** `components/ui/sheet.jsx`

**Changes:**

### **3. Global Modal Styles**

**Added:**
```css
/* Modal overlay - strong dark background */
[data-radix-dialog-overlay] {
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8) !important;
  backdrop-filter: blur(12px) !important;
}

/* Modal content - proper contrast */
[data-radix-dialog-content] {
  background: white !important;
  border: 2px solid rgba(202, 138, 4, 0.2) !important;
  box-shadow: 0 25px 50px -12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) !important;
}

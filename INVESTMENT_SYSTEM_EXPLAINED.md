## 💰 How Investment Works (Step-by-Step)

### **Step 1: User Browses Investment Opportunities**
- User navigates to the "Investments" page
- Views all 5 categories with available assets
- Sees **live pricing**, **24-hour price changes**, and **risk indicators**

### **Step 2: Selecting an Asset**
User clicks **"Invest Now"** on any asset (e.g., Bitcoin at $45,000)

**Requirements:**
- ✅ Account must be **active** (not deactivated)
- ✅ Account balance must be **≥ asset minimum price**
- ✅ KYC verification **not required** for investments (simplified)

### **Step 3: Investment Modal Opens**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Invest in Bitcoin (BTC)            │
│                                     │
│  Current Price: $45,000             │
│  Your Balance: $10,000              │
│                                     │
│  Enter Amount: [$ 5,000]            │
│  You will receive: 0.1111 BTC       │
│                                     │
│  [Cancel]  [Confirm Investment]     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- User enters investment amount (e.g., **$5,000**)
- System calculates **quantity**: `Amount ÷ Price` = **0.1111 BTC**
- User confirms

### **Step 4: Backend Processing**

When user clicks **"Confirm Investment"**, the system:

1. **Validates User & Balance**
   ```javascript
   if (userBalance < investmentAmount) {
     return "Insufficient balance"
   }
   ```

2. **Deducts from Account Balance**
   ```
   Old Balance: $10,000
   Investment: -$5,000
   New Balance: $5,000
   ```

3. **Creates Investment Record**
   ```javascript
   {
     user_id: "user123",
     category: "crypto",
     asset_name: "Bitcoin",
     amount: 5000,           // Amount invested ($)
     quantity: 0.1111,       // Quantity purchased
     purchase_price: 45000,  // Price at time of purchase
     current_price: 45000,   // Initially same as purchase
     status: "active",
     created_at: "2025-10-20T10:30:00Z"
   }
   ```

4. **Creates Transaction Record**
   ```javascript
   {
     type: "withdrawal",
     amount: 5000,
     description: "Investment in Bitcoin (BTC)",
     status: "completed"
   }
   ```

5. **Sends Notification**
   ```
   "You have invested $5,000 in Bitcoin."
   ```

## 📈 How Profits/Losses Are Calculated

### **Current Implementation: SIMULATED**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The current system uses **simulated price changes**, not real market data.

### **Method 1: Random Variance (Current)**
```javascript
// In investments-content.jsx (lines 72-77)
const portfolioValue = investments.reduce((sum, inv) => {
  const currentValue = inv.current_price && inv.quantity 
    ? parseFloat(inv.current_price) * parseFloat(inv.quantity)
    : parseFloat(inv.amount) * (1 + (Math.random() * 0.2 - 0.05))
    // Random variance: -5% to +15%
  return sum + currentValue
}, 0)
```

**What This Means:**
- Each time the page loads, portfolio value **fluctuates randomly** between **-5% and +15%**
- This creates a **demo/simulation** effect
- **NOT connected to real market prices**

### **Example Calculation:**

**Investment:**
- Amount: $5,000
- Asset: Bitcoin
- Quantity: 0.1111 BTC
- Purchase Price: $45,000/BTC

**Scenario A: Price Increases to $50,000**
```
Current Value = Quantity × Current Price
              = 0.1111 × $50,000
              = $5,555

Profit = Current Value - Invested Amount
       = $5,555 - $5,000
       = +$555 (11.1% gain)
```

**Scenario B: Price Decreases to $40,000**
```
Current Value = 0.1111 × $40,000
              = $4,444

Loss = $4,444 - $5,000
     = -$556 (11.1% loss)
```

## 📊 Portfolio Analytics

### **Dashboard Metrics**

Users see **4 key metrics** on the Investments page:

#### 1. **Total Invested**
```
Sum of all investment amounts (what user put in)
Example: $15,000
```

#### 2. **Portfolio Value**
```
Current market value of all investments
Example: $16,850
Calculation: Σ(quantity × current_price)
```

#### 3. **Total Return**
```
Profit or Loss in dollars
Example: +$1,850
Calculation: Portfolio Value - Total Invested
Color: Green (profit) / Red (loss)
```

#### 4. **Return Percentage**
```
Profit or Loss as percentage
Example: +12.33%
Calculation: (Total Return ÷ Total Invested) × 100
```

## ❓ FAQ for Client Presentations

### **Q: Is this using real money?**
A: No, this is a simulated platform. Users have virtual account balances and can make virtual investments. Perfect for demo and testing.

### **Q: Are the prices real?**
A: Currently, no. Prices are mock data representing realistic market prices. However, the system is designed to easily integrate real market data APIs.

### **Q: Can users cash out investments?**
A: Not in the current version. Investments are tracked, but the sell/withdraw feature is on the roadmap.

### **Q: How often do prices update?**
A: Currently, prices are static. With real API integration, they can update in real-time, every minute, or on-demand.

### **Q: What happens if the market crashes?**
A: With real data, users would see losses reflected in their portfolio value. With simulated data, it uses random variance.

### **Q: Can admin control investment prices?**
A: Yes, admins could manually update the `current_price` field in the database to simulate market movements for demos.

### **Q: Is there a minimum investment?**
A: Technically yes - users must have enough balance to cover the asset's price. For flexibility, you could set a minimum (e.g., $10).

### **Q: What about taxes and regulations?**
A: This is a demo platform. For a production fintech app, you'd need:
- KYC/AML compliance
- Financial licenses
- Tax reporting (1099 forms in US)
- SEC registration (if handling real securities)

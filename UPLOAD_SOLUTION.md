# 🔧 KYC Upload Solution

## ⚠️ Important: Use Small Files!

The multipart data issue in Next.js 15 requires us to use **smaller files**.

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION: Keep Files Under 3MB Each**

### **Why?**
- Next.js 15 + Turbopack has stricter limits
- Base64 encoding increases file size
- Smaller files = faster, more reliable uploads

---

## 📊 **New File Size Limits:**

| File Type | Maximum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Profile Photo** | 3MB | **< 1MB** ✅ |
| **ID Front** | 3MB | **< 2MB** ✅ |
| **ID Back** | 3MB | **< 2MB** ✅ |
| **Total All Files** | 9MB | **< 5MB** ✅ |

## 🎯 **How to Get Small Files:**

### **Method 1: Take Screenshots** (Easiest!)
Instead of using camera photos:
1. Open your photo on screen
2. Press **Windows + Shift + S**
3. Select area
4. Save screenshot
5. Screenshot files are usually < 500KB!

### **Method 2: Compress Images** (Best Quality)
1. Go to **https://tinypng.com**
2. Upload your photos
3. Download compressed versions
4. Compression reduces to ~30% of original size!

Example:
- Original: 8MB → Compressed: 2.4MB ✅

### **Method 3: Use Phone at Lower Quality**
- Open camera settings
- Change to "Lower quality" or "Medium"
- Take photos
- Transfer to computer

### **Method 4: Resize Images**
- Use Paint (Windows) or Preview (Mac)
- Resize to 1920x1080 or smaller
- Save
- Much smaller file!

## 🧪 **Test with These Files:**

### **For Testing (Use Any Small Image):**
You can use the SAME small image for all 3 uploads just to test:
- Use a screenshot (< 500KB)
- Upload it as profile photo
- Upload it as ID front  
- Skip ID back (it's optional)

**This proves the upload works!**

## ✅ **What to Do Now:**

### **1. Compress Your Files**

-- Enable UUID extension (if not already enabled)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

-- Credit Card Requests table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS credit_card_requests (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id TEXT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')),
  requested_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  processed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  processed_by UUID REFERENCES admins(id)
);
